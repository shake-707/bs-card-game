          <h2>Instructions:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>The game is played with a standard 52-card deck.</li>
            <li>Players take turns placing cards face down in the center, claiming what they are (e.g., "two Jacks").</li>
            <li>Other players can challenge by calling "BS!" if they think it's a lie.</li>
            <li>If the cards are not what was claimed, the liar picks up the pile. If they were honest, the challenger picks it up.</li>
            <li>The goal is to be the first to get rid of all your cards.</li>
